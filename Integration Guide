How Lootboxes works internally

A lootbox is an item that requires some method to open it. Currently there are two major methods, using a lockpick (or snapgun, which works as a reusable low-pick solution), or opening with a skeleton key.

When a lootbox is created, it generates the loot it will store in two stages.

1. Roll to create a 'template' of loot. A template is a collection of item groups and the quantity that will be picked from that item group. These are based on entries in the pools directory.
2. Iterate through the template and subsitute out the item groups for actual items. The mapping of item groups to items in those groups is handled in 'contents' directory.

Templates / Box Pools



Adding new boxes

Define new sections in a file under gamedata\configs\items\items\lootbox_[yourname].ltx
Make sure you do not use any existing sections. Lootboxes that come with this mod all use numbers, so mix some letters in your naming convention.

Breakdown of lootbox fields:
- Difficulty: How many lockpicks are required to open the box (when used with lockpick set, of course)
- Contents: Corresponds to a drop pool - consult loot_pools for info
- Loot_type: This is one of two types, either weapon or grab. Weapon means the box holds a single gun with ammo and attachments. Grab means it holds multiple items that are picked randomly.
- 'Weapon' loot types refer to a contents pool directly. 'Grab' goes through one layer of loot pool, then
