Adding new boxes

Define new sections in a file under gamedata\configs\items\items\lootbox_[custom].ltx
Make sure you do not use any existing sections. Lootboxes that come with this mod all use numbers, so mix some letters in your naming convention.

Breakdown of lootbox fields:
- Difficulty: How much % of lockpick set is used to open the box
- Contents: Corresponds to a drop pool - consult loot_pools for info
- Loot_type: This is one of two types, either weapon or grab. Weapon means the box holds a single gun with ammo and attachments. Grab means it holds multiple items that are picked randomly.
- 'Weapon' loot types refer to a contents pool directly. 'Grab' goes through one layer of loot pool, then picks items.
- Unique contents: There is a 1/10 chance a given box will spawn with unique loot. This is usually story-based stuff. Once spawned, it will never roll again. TODO is to implement multiple variants of unique boxes.

Adding loot to your boxes

Lootboxes use two layers of randomization to populate their contents.
Pool: This is a template of the 'contents' of a lootbox. A pool looks like this:

handguns,1,ammo_mix,3,ammo_grenades,1

This means the box will pick one item from the 'handguns' category of items, 1 from the 'ammo_grenades', and up to 3 from 'ammo_mix'.
A lootbox can pick from multiple such templates, rolled uniformly randomly.
To add pools to an existing lootbox, use the script function custom_loot.add_pool

Contents: These are categories of items. They look like the following:

[lootbox_handguns]
wpn_pm
wpn_pm|1
wpn_pmm
wpn_pb

This means that when a lootbox picks its contents from the 'handguns' category, it will randomly select one of these items. Note that 'wpn_pm' has two entries - you can use | to denote multiple entries in one section.
To add items to an existing contents category, use the script function custom_loot.add_contents

Adding boxes to drops
You can add boxes to drop by using the custom_loot.add_to_map function.
