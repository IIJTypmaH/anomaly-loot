How Lootboxes works internally

A lootbox is an item that requires some method to open it. Currently there are two major methods, using a lockpick (or snapgun, which works as a reusable low-pick solution), or opening with a skeleton key.

When a lootbox is created, it generates the loot it will store in two stages.

1. Roll to create a 'template' of loot. A template is a collection of item groups and the quantity that will be picked from that item group. These are based on entries in the pools directory.
2. Iterate through the template and subsitute out the item groups for actual items. The mapping of item groups to items in those groups is handled in 'contents' directory.

Stages of loot rolling
There is one major step between boxes and picking items to be in those boxes - item pools
An item pool is a list of items and weights. When an item pool is selected, it will randomly pick one entry from the pool and roll against the chance to lock it in. 

For example:
[meds_low]
bandage,2
stimpack = 0.7
medkit
survival_kit = 0.5

This is the item pool for medical items. When an item is selected from here, it will perform an additional roll against the weight (value after =, defaults to 1/guaranteed) to secure it. If survival_kit is picked randomly, it will make an additional roll against 0.5 (50%) to confirm it - otherwise it will pick another entry at random and repeat.

Boxes follow a similar logic, containing several item pools. For example:

[briefcase]:default ; 8000, 8-12
;                                                          Size     Limit   Chance
docs_low												 = 1, 		10, 	0.7
docs_med												 = 2, 		5, 		0.5
docs_high												 = 4, 		2, 		0.1
Here is a truncated config for briefcase items. 
All lootboxes have a capacity range defined in their section (check field items_range), and the capacity is randomly chosen in that range. 
Size is how much capacity one item from that pool will take - in this case, if we roll a 'docs_high', it will take up 4 spaces.
Limit is the cap on how many items from this pool can be added.
Chance is the difficulty of the extra roll required to lock this in.

Adding new boxes

Define new sections in a file under gamedata\configs\items\items\lootbox_[yourname].ltx
Make sure you do not use any existing sections. Lootboxes that come with this mod all use numbers, so mix some letters in your naming convention.

Breakdown of lootbox fields:
- Difficulty: How many lockpicks are required to open the box (when used with lockpick set, of course)
- Contents: Corresponds to a drop pool - consult box_contents for info
- Loot_type: This is one of two types, either weapon or grab. 'Weapon' loot types refer to a contents pool directly and adds a weapon with a chance ot add ammo for that weapon. 'Grab' picks items from the contents til the limit is reached.
- items_range: Range of items to populate in the box.
