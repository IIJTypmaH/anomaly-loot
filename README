Adds lootboxes to the game.

Lootboxes have a chance to spawn in stashes and on dead stalkers. Each lootbox will generally describe its contents, but it is randomized.

To open lootboxes, you need to use a lockpick set. Lockpick sets are sold by mechanics. Drag and drop the lockpick set onto the lootbox to open it. Each lootbox has a difficulty rating - this is the condition of the lockpick set that will be consumed when the box is opened. To repair the lockpick set, drag lockpicks onto the set that can be acquired from traders or from drops in the world.

Quick box opening tutorial:
1. You found a box. Hooray!
2. Buy a lockpick set from the mechanic.
3. Note the difficulty on the box. For example, say the box difficulty is 10%.
4. Drag your lockpick set over the box.
5. Enjoy your loot!
6. To fix your lockpick set up, drag and drop lockpicks or lockpick bundles onto your lockpick set.

No conflicts with anything, but not really balanced with Artefact Renovation. I have a tweak to address this. 

New game not required, as everything is handled dynamically. MCM support present. If you want to uninstall get rid of all the boxes and picks you have.

Other mod makers can integrate with lootboxes, adding items they have created into lootboxes. Consult custom_loot for usage information.
